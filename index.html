      <p class=" mt-2 leading-relaxed">
        An Operating System (OS) is the most important software that runs on a computer or mobile device. It works as a bridge between the user and the computer hardware. 
        Without an OS, a computer cannot function. It controls and manages both the hardware (like CPU, memory, hard drives) and software (applications and programs) of 
        the system. When you turn on your computer or smartphone, the first thing that loads is the operating system.
         The OS provides a user interface, such as a desktop screen with icons, menus, and folders, which allows you to interact with the system easily. It also 
         manages tasks like running multiple programs at the same time (multitasking), saving and organizing files, and controlling devices like printers, keyboards, 
         and screens. It ensures that each program gets the resources it needs without affecting others.
         Popular operating systems include Microsoft Windows, macOS, Linux, and Android. Each is designed for specific types of devices like desktops, laptops, servers, 
         or smartphones.</p>
       <p class="leading-relaxed"> In simple terms, the OS is the “brain” of your computer that makes everything else work. It helps users perform daily tasks like browsing the internet, 
        writing documents, watching videos, and more by managing the internal operations of the machine.

    <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold text-blue-800 hover-glow">Introduction to CPU Scheduling</h2>
    <p class=" mt-2 leading-relaxed">
        CPU scheduling is a fundamental concept in operating systems that involves selecting one process from the ready queue to be executed by the CPU. 
        Since the CPU can execute only one process at a time, scheduling ensures that all processes get a fair chance to run. It improves overall system performance
         by efficiently managing the CPU’s time, reducing waiting time, and maximizing CPU utilization. Different scheduling algorithms are used based on system 
         requirements, such as priority, speed, and fairness.
